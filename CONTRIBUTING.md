# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project. Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional
documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community.

Please read through this document before submitting any issues or pull requests to ensure we have all the necessary
information to effectively respond to your bug report or contribution.

## Reporting Bugs/Feature Requests

We welcome you to use the GitHub issue tracker to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue, please check [existing open](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-solutions-constructs/issues), or [recently closed](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-solutions-constructs/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aclosed%20), issues to make sure somebody else hasn't already
reported the issue. Please try to include as much information as you can. Details like these are incredibly useful:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used
* Any modifications you've made relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment

## Contributing via Pull Requests

### Pull Request Checklist

* [ ] Title and Description
  - __Change type__: title prefixed with **fix**, **feat** and module name in parens, which will appear in changelog
  - __Title__: use lower-case and doesn't end with a period
  - __Breaking?__: last paragraph: "BREAKING CHANGE: <describe what changed + link for details>"
  - __Issues__: Indicate issues fixed via: "**Fixes #xxx**" or "**Closes #xxx**"

### Step 1: Open Issue

If there isn't one already, open an issue describing what you intend to contribute. It's useful to communicate in
advance, because sometimes, someone is already working in this space, so maybe it's worth collaborating with them
instead of duplicating the efforts.


### Step 2: Commit

Create a commit with the proposed changes:

* Commit title and message (and PR title and description) must adhere to [conventionalcommits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).
  * The title must begin with `feat(module): title`, `fix(module): title`, `refactor(module): title` or
    `chore(module): title`.
  * Title should be lowercase.
  * No period at the end of the title.

* Commit message should describe _motivation_. Think about your code reviewers and what information they need in
  order to understand what you did. If it's a big commit (hopefully not), try to provide some good entry points so
  it will be easier to follow.

* Commit message should indicate which issues are fixed: `fixes #<issue>` or `closes #<issue>`.

* Shout out to collaborators.

* If not obvious (i.e. from unit tests), describe how you verified that your change works.

* If this commit includes breaking changes, they must be listed at the end in the following format (notice how multiple breaking changes should be formatted):

```
BREAKING CHANGE: Description of what broke and how to achieve this behavior now
* **module-name:** Another breaking change
* **module-name:** Yet another breaking change
```

### Step 3: Pull Request

* Push to a GitHub fork or to a branch (naming convention: `<user>/<feature-bug-name>`)
* Submit a Pull Requests on GitHub.
* Please follow the PR checklist written below. We trust our contributors to self-check, and this helps that process!
* Discuss review comments and iterate until you get at least one “Approve”. When iterating, push new commits to the
  same branch. Usually all these are going to be squashed when you merge to master. The commit messages should be hints
  for you when you finalize your merge commit message.
* Make sure to update the PR title/description if things change. The PR title/description are going to be used as the
  commit title/message and will appear in the CHANGELOG, so maintain them all the way throughout the process.
