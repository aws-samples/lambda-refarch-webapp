# Serverless Reference Architecture:  Web Application

## Note: The Vote Application serverless reference architecture was originally in the lambda-refarch-webapp repository and has since moved to the lambda-refarch-voteapp repository.

The Serverless Web Application demonstrates how to use [AWS Lambda](http://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) in conjunction with [Amazon API Gateway](http://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [Amazon DynamoDB](http://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/), and [Amazon Cognito](http://aws.amazon.com/cognito/) to build a serverless web application.  

The site is a simple blog application that allows users to log in and create posts and comments. By leveraging these services, you can build cost-efficient web applications that don't require the overhead of managing servers.

This repository contains sample code for all the Lambda functions that make up the back end of the application, as well as an AWS CloudFormation template for creating the functions, API, DynamoDB tables, Amazon Cognito identity pool, and related resources.

## Running the example

The entire example system can be deployed in us-east-1 using the provided CloudFormation template and an S3 bucket.

Choose **Launch Stack** to launch the template in the us-east-1 region in your account:

[![Launch Serverless Web Application into North Virginia with CloudFormation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/images/cloudformation-launch-stack-button.png)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=us-east-1#/stacks/new?stackName=serverless-web-refarch&templateURL=https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-lambda-serverless-web-refarch/serverless-web-master.template)

After the stack is successfully created, you need to finish the configuration.

- Follow the instructions to minify the website code and push it to S3.  See the [website readme](http://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-lambda-serverless-web-refarch/website/Readme.md) for step-by-step instructions. Follow the **Updating the API Gateway SDK**, **Updating the Amazon Cognito identity ID and AWS region**, **Building**, and **Production Build** sections.  
- After you have done this, upload the website to the S3 bucket that you created via the CloudFormation script (that is, the bucket you specified for the `Hosting Bucket` parameter).

## Testing the example

After you've successfully uploaded the updated website to S3, go to the URL for the website.  You can find this URL listed in the outputs for the CloudFormation stack you ran earlier, listed as **WebsiteURL**. At this point, your website is up and running. Feel free to interact with it, create posts, comments, etc.

## Cleaning up the example resources

To remove all resources created by this example, do the following:

1. Delete all objects from the `Hosting Bucket` created by the CloudFormation stack.
1. Delete the CloudFormation stack.
1. Delete all CloudWatch log groups for each of the Lambda functions in the stack.
1. Delete the Amazon Cognito identity pool.

## CloudFormation template resources

The following sections explain all of the resources created by the CloudFormation template provided with this example.

### Website

- **WebsiteBucket** - An S3 bucket for the static assets of the web application.  The front-end JavaScript is uploaded to this bucket.

### Lambda functions

- **LambdaCreationHelperStack** - A sub-stack that creates a custom resource for writing entries to `ConfigTable`. This stack creates a Lambda function and execution role that grants UpdateItem permission on `ConfigTable`.
